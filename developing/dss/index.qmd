The **Deep Soil Sampling Visualization** app transforms technical soil data into accessible graphics and reports, complete with crop-specific interpretation. Deep soil sampling measures nitrogen and other nutrients at depth in the soil profile, revealing the history of nutrient management in a field. These results can show how nitrates have moved within the crop rooting zone or if they have moved below this zone - a critical indicator of potential groundwater contamination risk.

This app also guides users to nutrient and irrigation management resources that help prevent nitrate leaching to groundwater, and connects them to current crop-specific resources in [WSDA’s Zotero Library](https://wsda.quarto.pub/washi-gallery/tools/zotero/).
