This **Tool Gallery** showcases applications, calculators, R packages, and other resources developed primarily by the [Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA)](https://agr.wa.gov/departments/land-and-water/natural-resources/soil-health). These tools support science-based technical assistance for healthy soils as part of the [Washington Soil Health Initiative (WaSHI)](https://washingtonsoilhealthinitiative.com).

Each tile links to a dedicated page with direct access to the tool, source
code (if public), and related blog posts to explore and share the tools advancing soil health in Washington.
