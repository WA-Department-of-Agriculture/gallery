**Dirt Data Reports** is a web-based tool that makes it easy for anyone to upload their soil sampling data, enter project-specific information, and generate customized, research-based soil health reports to make farmers’ soil health data accessible and actionable. 

For more flexibility in content and aesthetic customization, see the [{soils} R package](/tools/soils/). This will require coding in [R](https://www.r-project.org/){target="_blank"} and using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/){target="_blank"}.
