**{soils}** is an R package for all your soil health data visualization and
reporting needs. {soils} provides an RStudio project template to generate
customized, interactive soil health reports. These reports include plots and
tables to show how the participantâ€™s results compare to simple averages of
results from samples of the same crop, same county, and across the entire
project.

For a no-code option, with less flexibility in content and aesthetic customization, see the [Dirt Data Reports web app](/tools/ddr/).
